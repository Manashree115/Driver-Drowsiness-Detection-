# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-
This is a system which can detect the drowsiness of the driver using CNN - Python, OpenCV

The aim of this is system to reduce the number of accidents on the road by detecting the drowsiness of the driver and warning them using an alarm. 

## Setup
To set the model up:<br />
Pre-install all the required libraries <br />1) OpenCV<br />
                                       2) Keras<br />
                                       3) Numpy<br />
                                       4) Pandas<br />
                                       5) OS<br />
Download the Dataset from the link given below and edit the address in the notebook accordingly.<br />
Run the Jupyter Notebook and add the model name in detect_drowsiness.py file in line 20.<br />

## The Dataset
The dataset which was used is a subnet of a dataset from(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset)<br />
it has 4 folder which are <br />1) Closed_eyes - having 726 pictures<br />
                          2) Open_eyes - having 726 pictures<br />
                          3) Yawn - having 725 pictures<br />
                          4) no_yawn - having 723 pictures<br />
